1. look at output/categorized_unknown_journals.txt for the journal cluster the user is asking about. specified journal cluster will be seen between two lines consisting entirely of "-" (dashes).
2. look in metapub/findit/journals to see if publisher/journal cluster is represented anywhere yet
3. if so, simply add those journal names to the existing publisher list (unless publisher template calls for more info). If those journals appear to be mapped to an existing publisher, investigate sample PMIDs for those journals individually to make sure we're mapping correctly. go to step 6.
4. if publisher isn't supported yet, create new file in metapub/findit/journals for that publisher and then (goto 5)
5. create a "dance" for this new publisher in metapub/findit/dances.py -- stop and ask what the name of the dance should be
6. if they don't exist yet, add a test using 3 PMIDs with different expected outcomes for this publisher. add to tests/findit
7. run tests and make sure they pass.  fix any tests that don't pass.
8. check output/categorized_unknown_journals.txt for "errant" journals belonging to this publisher that may have been added as one-offs further down in the file.

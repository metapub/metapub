"""
Single journal publishers - publishers that have exactly ONE journal.

This module contains configurations for publishers that publish exactly
one journal and use generic functions (the_doi_slide, the_vip_shake)
rather than custom dance functions.

These are true single-journal publishers, not multi-journal publishers
that happen to use simple patterns.

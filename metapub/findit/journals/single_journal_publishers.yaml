  description: 'Single journal publishers - publishers that have exactly ONE journal.


    This module contains configurations for publishers that publish exactly

    one journal and use generic functions (the_doi_slide, the_vip_shake)

    rather than custom dance functions.


    These are true single-journal publishers, not multi-journal publishers

    that happen to use simple patterns.'

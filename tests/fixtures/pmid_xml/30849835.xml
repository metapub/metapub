Conidium germination was assessed on a defined agar medium amended with either thiophanate-methyl (a benzimidazole) or vinclozolin (a di-carboximide). A total of 53 representative isolates were evaluated further for conidium germination and mycelium growth on fungicide-amended medium and for infection of geranium seedlings treated with thiophanate-methyl or vinclozolin at label rates. Isolates were considered sensitive to thiophanate-methyl or vinclozolin when the effective concentration of the fungicide active ingredient resulting in 50% inhibition of germination (EC<sub>50</sub>-germ) was &#x2264;5 &#x3bc;g/ml or when the effective concentration of fungicide active ingredient resulting in 50% inhibition of mycelium growth (EC<sub>50</sub>-growth) was &#x2264;1 &#x3bc;g/ml. Of all isolates, 81% (262/325) were resistant to thiophanate-methyl and 69% (223/325) were resistant to vinclozolin. Four phenotypes were observed: sensitive to both fungicides (17%), resistant to both fungicides (67%), resistant only to thiophanate-methyl (14%), and resistant only to vinclozolin (2%). Isolates resistant to at least one fungicide were found in 33 of the 35 locations from which samples were taken. Disease incidences on geranium seedlings treated with 600 &#x3bc;g/ml of thiophanate-methyl and then inoculated with isolates sensitive and resistant to this fungicide were 1.4 and 96.1%, respectively. Disease incidences on geranium seedlings treated with 600 &#x3bc;g/ml of vinclozolin and then inoculated with isolates sensitive and resistant to this fungicide were 0.3 and 91.9%, respectively. With thiophanate-methyl, correlation coefficients (r) between disease incidence and log EC<sub>50</sub>-germ or log EC<sub>50</sub>-growth were 0.987 and 0.992, respectively. With vinclozolin, correlation coefficients between disease incidence and log EC<sub>50</sub>-germ and log EC<sub>50</sub>-growth were 0.975 and 0.893, respectively. Correlation coefficients between the two EC<sub>50</sub> values for thiophanate-methyl were 0.989 and for vinclozolin were 0.900. Isolates sensitive to thiophanate-methyl had a mean EC<sub>50</sub>-germ value of 0.93 &#x3bc;g/ml and a EC<sub>50</sub>-growth value of 0.11 &#x3bc;g/ml. For isolates sensitive to vinclozolin the mean EC<sub>50</sub>-germ value was 1.63 &#x3bc;g/ml and the mean EC<sub>50</sub>-growth value was 0.26 &#x3bc;g/ml. Thiophanate-methyl-resistant isolates had mean EC<sub>50</sub>-germ and EC<sub>50</sub>-growth values greater than 500 &#x3bc;g/ml while vinclozolin-resistant isolates had a mean EC<sub>50</sub>-germ value greater than 500 &#x3bc;g/ml and a mean EC<sub>50</sub>-growth value of 3.18 &#x3bc;g/ml.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Yourman</LastName><ForeName>L F</ForeName><Initials>LF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Plant Pathology and Physiology, Clemson University, Clemson SC 29634-0377.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Jeffers</LastName><ForeName>S N</ForeName><Initials>SN</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Plant Pathology and Physiology, Clemson University, Clemson SC 29634-0377.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Plant Dis</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>9882809</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>0191-2917</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2019</Year><Month>3</Month><Day>10</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>1999</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>1</Day><Hour>0</Hour><Minute>0</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>1999</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>1</Day><Hour>0</Hour><Minute>1</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">30849835</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1094/PDIS.1999.83.6.569</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
